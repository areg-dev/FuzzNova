# FuzzNova: Automated Fuzz Testing Tool

**FuzzNova** is designed to assist developers and testers in identifying vulnerabilities in applications that process user 
input. It automates the generation of complex input strings and tests these strings against a specified application to 
check for crashes or improper input handling.
The main idea is to generate fuzzy strings using AI, which will contains target-related information to produce 
outputs more relevant to the specific application. This Python script can be greatly used in ethical hacking and penetration testing.

## Components

- **`main.py`**: Generates complex strings based on a variety of character sets and languages, intended to stress test application input handling.
- **`test.cpp`**: A simple C++ application that reads user input into a fixed-size buffer, designed to potentially overflow with unexpected input.
- **`test.py`**: Compiles `test.cpp` and runs the resulting executable with the test inputs generated by `main.py`, capturing and reporting any errors or crashes.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- GCC for compiling C++ code
- pytest for running Python tests

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```chatinput
git clone <repository-url>
cd FuzzNova
```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
```chatinput
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Security and API Key

**Important**: The API key used in `main.py` is for demonstration purposes only. It is crucial to replace `OPENAI_API_SECRET` with your own API key obtained from OpenAI. For security reasons, it is highly recommended to store your API key in an environment variable or a secure vault and reference it within the code, rather than hardcoding it directly into source files.


## Usage

1. **Compile and test the C++ application:**
```
python test.py
```

This script invokes `main.py` to generate test inputs, saves them to `output.txt`, and then runs the C++ executable with each input line to check for crashes.
Test cases are randomly check cpp code which is vulnerable to the buffer overflow attacks, so you may see random number of passed and failed tests

2. **Generate test inputs manually:**
```chatinput
python main.py -t "Linux GCC C++" -v 10 -s 100
```

Parameters:
- `-t`: Target description (e.g., "Linux GCC C++")
- `-v`: Number of variations to generate
- `-s`: Maximum size of each input string

## How It Works

- **Input Generation**: `main.py` generates input strings using OpenAI's API, incorporating complex character combinations from multiple languages and special symbols.
- **Testing**: `test.py` compiles `test.cpp` and tests it with generated inputs, looking for any errors or system crashes that indicate vulnerabilities.
